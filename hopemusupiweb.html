            <p>
                Hello! My name is Hope Musupi, and I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong passion for web development and technology.
                I enjoy creating structured and user-friendly websites while continuously learning new concepts in programming and software development.
                I am particularly interested in problem-solving, logical thinking, and building solutions that are both practical and meaningful.
                In my free time, I enjoy reading technology-related articles, practicing coding challenges, and collaborating on academic projects.
                My goal is to grow into a professional web developer and contribute to impactful technology-driven solutions.
