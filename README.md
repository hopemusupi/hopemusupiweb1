## QUESTION 2: HTML ELEMENTS

### 2.1 Five Challenging Elements

1. **`<table>`** – Required careful organization of rows and columns to properly display structured data.  
2. **`<nav>`** – Structuring navigation links properly for smooth internal page navigation.  
3. **`<form>`** – Understanding how to correctly use input fields and labels.  
4. **`<article>`** – Knowing when to use `<article>` instead of `<section>`.  
5. **`<textarea>`** – Adjusting rows and columns to allow enough space for user input.

---

### 2.2 Use of Semantic Elements

I used semantic elements such as **`<header>`** for the website introduction, **`<nav>`** for navigation links, **`<section>`** for grouping related content, **`<article>`** for project information, and **`<footer>`** for copyright and closing information.

---

### 2.3 Most Useful Element

The **`<section>`** element was the most useful because it allowed me to group related content clearly and improved the readability and organization of the website.

## QUESTION 3: HTML ATTRIBUTES

### 3.1 Three Essential Attributes

1. **`href`** – Used for navigation links to connect different sections of the page.  
2. **`id`** – Used for internal page navigation and uniquely identifying elements.  
3. **`type`** – Used in form inputs to define the kind of data being entered.

---

### 3.2 Difference Between `class` and `id`

The **`id`** attribute was used for unique sections such as navigation targets, while the **`class`** attribute would be used to style or group multiple elements if CSS were added.

---

### 3.3 Attribute That Improved User Experience

The **`placeholder`** attribute improved user experience by guiding users on what information to enter in form fields.

## QUESTION 4: DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

- I planned the website structure using a semantic HTML layout before coding.  
- I tested the website by opening the HTML file in a web browser and fixing any errors.  
- Challenges included organizing content and remembering different HTML elements, which I overcame by referring to HTML documentation and examples.

## QUESTION 5: GIT & GITHUB IMPLEMENTATION

### Git Commands Used

1. `git init`  
2. `git add .`  
3. `git commit -m "Initial website structure"`  
4. `git push`

---

### Commits

I made two commits sections of the website to keep track of changes.

---

### Importance of Version Control

Version control is important because it helps track changes, allows collaboration, and makes it possible to recover previous versions of a project.

## QUESTION 6: CODE QUALITY & BEST PRACTICES

1. I ensured my HTML was valid and error-free by using proper indentation and validation tools.  
2. I followed best practices such as semantic HTML usage, meaningful element names, and readable code structure.  
3. If given more time, I would add CSS styling and more interactivity to improve the appearance and functionality of the website.
